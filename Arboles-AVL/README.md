# AVL Trees
This is a simple algorithm that simulates the AVL Tree behaviour.
## How it works?
The AVL tree structure has a simple logic that says that the branches can only have a diference on their height of 1, this can be helpful for search algorithm because it lowers the time of the request in the tree.
## Interface
It has a simple interface on JOptionPane, and it convert the tree to a String to print it in the pane.
