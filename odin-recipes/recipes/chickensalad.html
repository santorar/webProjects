    <p>Terrific lunchtime or picnic salad, hearty enough to be a meal!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
      <li>1/2 package rotini pasta</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped celery</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>2 green onions, sliced</li>
      <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a pot with lightly-salted water and bring to a boil. Cook the
        chicken breast in the boiling water until no longer pink in the center
        and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the center of the chicken breast should read at least 165
        degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut the breast into cubes and spread in a
        single layer on a plate; place chicken in refrigerator for 1 hour, or
        until completely cooled.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill a pot with lightly-salted water and bring to a boil. Stir the pasta
        into the boiling water; cook until the pasta has cooked through, but is
        still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain, and rinse thoroughly
        with cold water to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir the celery, Parmesan cheese, green onions, mayonnaise, sour cream,
        milk, parsley, basil, and thyme together in a large bowl. Fold the
        chicken, rotini, and peas into the mayonnaise mixture. Season with salt
        and pepper. Chill in refrigerator for 1 hour.
      </li>
